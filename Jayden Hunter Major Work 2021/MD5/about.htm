        <h4>Message Digest 5</h4>
        <p>
            Message Digest 5 (or MD5) is a hashing function first published in 1992. Hash functions, like MD5, are algorithms designed to convert data of any length into a small identifying value.
            This small value can be used for verifying downloads, as a download can be hashed and compared against source as a quick verification that no data has been lost in transmission.
          </br></br>
          MD5 was developed to be a cryptographic hash function, where the hashing process is impossible to reverse. This means it would ideally be suited for secure data verification, as it would be uncrackable for any hackers to decrypt, unless they used brute force to try and find its original message.
          </br></br>
          However, despite the best attempts of the developers, MD5 is a very broken function in todays' world. As discussed throughout this website, MD5 contains many flaws and is easily reversed by hackers due to the increase in computer processing speeds and storage capacity.

        <h4>
            Why should I care?
        </h4>
        <p>
          MD5, as much as it is flawed, is still used in a quarter of Content Management Systems (CMS), which means that the use of MD5 today is something that cryptographically affects everyone online.
